This project explores the use of wastewater analysis to monitor drug consumption in seven Canadian cities, leveraging a Statistics Canada (2024) dataset that categorizes drug metabolites into Prescribed and Unprescribed groups. This approach highlights correlations between drug detection and consumption patterns, offering valuable insights for public health systems to address drug-related crises and inform resource allocation and policy-making.
